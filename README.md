### Log Analysis

This tool uses Python version 3 to analise the PostgreSQL database of an newspaper site and answer 3 big questions:

<dl>
  <dd>> Top 3 most viewed articles</dd>
  <dd>> Most Popular Authors</dd>
  <dd>> Days where site requests failed more than 1% of the time</dd>
</dl>

[psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) is used to easily connect Python and PostgreSQL.
To run this project locally, you'll need to set-up the views included in the ```views.sql``` file.
